## Summary

✅ **COMPLETED**: Full Polymarket Analyzer implementation with prediction tracking

### Key Features Implemented:
- **Market Analysis**: Real-time data from Polymarket CLOB API with fair value calculations
- **News Integration**: NewsAPI integration with smart correlation and sentiment analysis  
- **Prediction Tracking**: Automatic logging of high-confidence predictions for hit rate analysis
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive analytics with ROI tracking and confidence calibration
- **Interactive Console**: Rich CLI interface with detailed displays and command system
- **Export Capabilities**: CSV export and manual prediction resolution
- **Risk Assessment**: Multi-dimensional scoring and risk categorization

### Architecture:
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation between data clients, analyzers, and console interface
- **Async Architecture**: Non-blocking API calls with rate limiting and caching
- **Type Safety**: Full Pydantic models for data validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new analysis methods or data sources

## Completed Tasks
### 2025-07-08: Unit Test Suite Implementation
- ✅ Created comprehensive unit tests for all major components:
  - **test_market_analyzer.py**: 15 tests covering market analysis, scoring, and integration
  - **test_news_correlator.py**: 10 tests for news correlation and categorization
  - **test_kelly_criterion.py**: 15 tests for position sizing calculations
  - **test_backtesting.py**: 16 tests for prediction tracking and metrics
  - **test_market_categorizer.py**: 15 tests for dynamic categorization
- ✅ All 71 tests passing successfully
- ✅ Test coverage includes:
  - Happy path scenarios
  - Edge cases and error handling
  - Integration between components
  - Data validation and model behavior

## Discovered During Work

### 2025-07-08: API and Market Issues Resolved
- ✅ **Issue**: Analyzer finding 0 opportunities despite analyzing markets
  - **Root Cause**: Both Polymarket APIs returning historical markets marked as active but with past end dates
  - **Solution**: Added timezone-aware date filtering to exclude expired markets
  
- ✅ **Issue**: Timezone handling errors ("can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes")
  - **Root Cause**: Mixed use of timezone-naive and timezone-aware datetime objects
  - **Solution**: Updated all datetime operations to use UTC timezone consistently across 10+ files
  
- ✅ **Issue**: NewsAPI rate limiting (HTTP 429 errors)
  - **Root Cause**: Free tier limits (100 requests/day) being exceeded
  - **Solution**: 
    - Adjusted rate limiter to 1 request per 2 seconds
    - Added graceful error handling to return empty responses instead of crashing
    - Implemented 15-minute caching to reduce API calls
    - Added request batching and early exit on rate limit errors
