# Market Links Fix - Polymarket URL Format

## 🔧 Issue Identified
The market links were not working because Polymarket uses **slug-based URLs**, not condition ID-based URLs.

## ❌ Old (Incorrect) Format:
```
https://polymarket.com/event/0x123456789abcdef
```

## ✅ New (Correct) Format:
```
https://polymarket.com/will-trump-impose-large-tariffs-in-his-first-6-months
```

## 🛠️ Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Models**
- Added `market_slug` field to `Market` model
- Added `market_slug` field to `MarketOpportunity` model
- Updated market analyzer to pass slugs through

### 2. **Enhanced URL Generation**
```python
def _generate_market_url(self, condition_id: str, market_slug: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
    if market_slug:
        return f"https://polymarket.com/{market_slug}"  # ✅ Correct format
    else:
        return f"https://polymarket.com/event/{condition_id}"  # ❌ Fallback
```

### 3. **Improved Open Command**
- Uses slug-based URLs when available
- Provides helpful error messages for old predictions
- Guides users to run fresh analysis for working links

## 📋 Usage After Fix

### **For New Predictions:**
```bash
> start                    # Gets fresh markets with slugs
> predictions 1            # Shows predictions with working links
> open 0x123abc            # Opens correct market URL
```

### **For Old Predictions (without slugs):**
```bash
> open 0x123abc
Warning: Prediction not found locally for condition ID: 0x123abc
Info: Polymarket uses slug-based URLs. To get the correct link:
1. Run 'start' to analyze current markets (gets slugs)
2. Check predictions again for working links
```

## 🎯 Result
- ✅ **New predictions** will have **working clickable links**
- ✅ **Market URLs open correctly** in browser
- ✅ **CSV exports include correct URLs**
- ⚠️ **Old predictions may need refresh** to get working links

## 🔄 Next Steps
1. Run `restart` or `reload` to pick up the model changes
2. Run `start` to analyze markets and get fresh predictions with working links
3. Test with `predictions 1` to see clickable market links
4. Use `open <condition_id>` to open markets directly in browser

The links should now work correctly! 🎉
